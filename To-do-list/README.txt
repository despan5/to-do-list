# Overview

This is a To-Do list app made in Swift that lets the user add tasks with a due date and time. Once the user finishes the task, they can mark it as done and can choose to delete completed tasks when needed.

I created this app because I constantly have many things that need to be done and this allows me to organize everything in a neat way. Now I can see all my tasks on an easy and simple app.
